# Power Management concepts
- CPU governor (Energy Policy)
    *Note to enable or disable intel_pstate driver (HWP), just write in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/status`*
    - HWP (Hardware Managed P-state) when intel_pstate is active (driver=intel_pstate) (Sandy Bridge and More)
        - Powersave (=schedutil)
            * powersave
            * performance
